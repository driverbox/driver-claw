<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

driver-claw is a Python-based command-line utility for downloading the latest PC hardware drivers and diagnostic tools. Leveraging Selenium, it automatically navigates official websites and motherboard manufacturers' pages to locate and retrieve the most up-to-date versions of essential drivers and utilities.

This tool also serves as a companion to [driver-box](https://github.com/markmybytes/driver-box/). Refer to the [Usage](#usage) section for more information.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

###  Specify 7-Zip Executable Location

This tool uses 7-Zip to archive and extract files. If the 7-Zip executable is not available in the system's PATH, you can specify its location using the `PATH_LIB_7ZIP` environment variable.

```sh
# CMD
set "PATH_LIB_7ZIP=C:/<path-to-7zip>" && python src/main.py

# Powershell
$env:PATH_LIB_7ZIP="C:/<path-to-7zip>"; python src/main.py
```

### Customise Crawl Configurations

The default claw configuration is located in `src/config.py`, which includes a curated list of common hardware drivers and diagnostic tools.
To use a custom configuration file, specify it with the `-c` or `--claw-config` option. The tool accepts both JSON and Python source files.

The module `src/url.py` provides helper methods to extract download URLs from well-known hardware manufacturers and vendors. You can leverage these utilities when drafting your own claw configuration.

#### JSON file

Refer to the [JSON Schema](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/markmybytes/driver-claw/main/claw-config-schema.json) for guidance on constructing a valid claw configuration.

```sh
python src/main.py -c ./custom-config.json
```

#### Python source file

When using a Python file, driver-claw will look for a variable named `CLAW_CONFIG` defined in the specified source.
Refer to the `DriverClaw` class for the expected structure and type details.

```sh
python src/main.py -c ./custom-config.py
```

###  Including Extra Files in the Archive

Use `-i` or `--include-files` to specify the file or directory paths you want to include in the output archive.
To include multiple paths, either separate them with spaces or provide the option multiple times.

```sh
python src/main.py -i foo/ bar/ -i README.md
```

The `conf/` directory contains configuration files for the default set of drivers and tools used by driver-box.
To use this tool to download drivers and utilities for driver-box, include the directory as input:

```sh
python src/main.py -i conf/
```
